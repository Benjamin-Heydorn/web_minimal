# Overview

By doing this project, I experienced some of what the Rust language syntax looks like.

To be clear, I did not write this code, but I followed a tutorial on how to do it. A link to the original code owner is below under 'Useful Websites'

I chose to do a web service because I had worked one before in Golang during an internship and wanted a refresh on what they're like.
